Dockerized hello world Python Service
=====================================

Very simple endpoint implemented in Python (using Flask) that returns a "Hello
World" and the hostname when receiving a GET request.

Used to play around with Docker and Consul in a series of posts
[here](http://jlordiales.me/tags/#Docker).
